        <strong>🤔 How does Eva calculate my next period?</strong><br>
        <span style="color: #6c757d; margin-top: 0.5rem; display: block;">
            Eva analyzes your previous cycle data to predict your next period. The more data you provide, the more accurate our predictions become. We use your cycle length patterns and timing to give you the best estimate possible.

            Yes! You'll receive a gentle email reminder 3 days before your predicted period start date. This gives you time to prepare and plan accordingly.
